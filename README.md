# Higurashi: When They Cry Google Translated

This project is a mod of the visual novel(s) Higurashi: When They Cry. I took all the text in the game, inserted them into Google Translate, translated them into multiple different languages, and then back to English to make some (hopefully) hilarious gibberish/nonsense!

As of right now, half of Onikakushi has been translated. I'm hoping on having the entire series translated at some point. Feedback would be appreciated!

This mod requires the 07th mod to work.

I've only tested the mod on ADV mode so far, so if you found problems with the other modes, please tell me about it!
